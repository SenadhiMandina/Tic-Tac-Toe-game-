# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
A console-based Tic Tac Toe game in Python where two players can play against each other. The game runs entirely in the terminal and tracks the game board until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)  
- Input validation to prevent overwriting an occupied cell  
- Detects and announces:
  - Win for Player X or Player O  
  - Draw when all cells are filled without a winner  
- Replay option to start a new game without restarting the program  

## How to Run

2. Place the Python script (`tic_tac_toe.py`) in a folder of your choice.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run:
